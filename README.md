# 8599 Ray Tracer Integrated with Walnut GUI

## Housekeeping

- To just use the application, run the executable (which I will distribute after I have finished implementing this software ray tracer).

- To run from the source code, we need:

  - [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.com)
  - [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#windows)
  
  Then, execute `scripts/Setup.bat` after cloning the repository, this will generate the Visual Studio 2022 solution for us. Note that current implementation requires C++20 or above.
